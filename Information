# Unit-2

• How have you organized your portfolio and why is it in this order?
My portfolio is organized by what we cover in class. It is done this way to make it easier for myself and others to understand the progression.
• Why have you chosen these particular pieces to demonstrate your learning?
I chose these because the main project was to create an IOT which me and my partner did using a raspberry pi.
• Which piece in your portfolio are you most proud of? Why?
I am most proud of the client side because it is used to connect to the server, because it is the individual communicator that can connect and speak with the server from any network connection.
• What piece would you like to remove from this collection? Why?
I would remove utility section because having 3 files to run a program seems to be a bit much for a simple server set up.

The complexity of connecting multiple devices through a simple port over a wifi connection is amazing.
